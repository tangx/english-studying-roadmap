## Expressions

### 1. same 和 different

对与 **定冠词 the**， same 和 different 使用习惯不一样

1. **the** same: It is `the` same.
2.  ~~the~~ different: It is ~~(x)~~ different.

不要问为什么， 就是习惯。 对与习惯，作为学习者而非学究， 应该 **少问 Why， 多问 What 和 How**。

### 2. come/go upstairs

come 和 go 在方位上是有区别的。 come 是 **由远及近**， go 相反， 是 **由近及远**。

但是 **上楼** come/go upstaris 在口语中并没有区分那么多, 都可以用。 同理 **下楼** come/go downstairs。


### 3. and 表示目的

听首歌 [《come and see me》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxbop3gMTxo)

在 `Come upstairs and see it` 中， `and` 不表示 **和**， 而是表示 **目的**。

本案例中， A 邀请 B 上楼看衬衣， 两人在一起 **闲谈**， 因此比较随意， 不用 `Come upstaris to see it`。

关于 come `and` see me 和 come `to` see me 的区别， Google Bard （AI） 回答如下。 

主要区别在于:

1. **and** 表示  **informal 非正式** 和 **immediate 立即**
2. **to** 表示 **formal 正式**。 通常在后面还需要接 **地址、时间** 等状语， 作为 **邀约/预约**。


The main difference between "come and see me" and "come to see me" is that the former is more `informal and immediate`. It is typically used when inviting someone to come to your location right away. For example, you might say "come and see me" to a coworker who is standing nearby, or to a child who is playing in the yard.

"Come to see me," on the other hand, is `more formal` and `can be used to invite someone to come to your location at a later time or date`. For example, you might say "come to see me in my office tomorrow" to a subordinate, or "come to see me at the hospital when you get a chance" to a friend who is in the hospital.

Here are some examples of how the two phrases can be used in different contexts:

"Come and see me in my office." (formal, inviting someone to come to your office at a later time)
"Come and see me if you have any questions." (informal, inviting someone to come to you if they need help)
"Come and see me when you're free." (informal, inviting someone to come to your location at a later time that is convenient for them)
"Come to see me when you're in town." (formal, inviting someone to come to your location when they are in the same city or town as you)
"Come to see me at the party on Saturday." (formal, inviting someone to come to a party that you are attending)
In general, it is best to use "come to see me" in formal situations, such as when writing a business email or inviting someone to a professional event. "Come and see me" is more appropriate for informal situations, such as speaking to friends and family.
