# How to learn a language

When you wake up in the morning or when you have time tomorrow, you'll need to read every message that I have sent you. There will be several messages waiting on you. Until then sleep well and goodnight.🙂👍🙏

It is to your benefit to take your time and read very carefully the information I have to send you.

This needs to be read all the way through before we can continue.

They are beneficial techniques to help your English progression and also about how I help people on this app.🙂👍🙏

Read books, get dictionaries, talk to natives, listen to them as well, write things down, watch American entertainment, listen to everything, repeat everything, make it fun.

Look on the internet for something called "synonyms." Synonyms are words that are similar to other words. This will help you build your vocabulary.

It is also important to understand American English entertainment like movies and tv shows should really only be viewed for educational purposes only not for entertainment. Until you have come to a point where you understand most of what's being said.

Also, when you view the movies and tv shows, subtitles are extremely important. When you watch them, you should stop the movie or show when you see a word you don't understand. Then you write the word down, find out the definition, try to understand it and then start the tv show or movie again from the point that you stopped the Show or movie at.

Practice, mimic, practice, mimic, listen, repeat, listen, repeat, until it sounds the same. 

Nothing is ever going to happen immediately. It takes time, it takes practice, it takes patience and it takes the desire to continue to move forward. No matter the challenges, the decision is your choice.

Then start listening to audio books

When you want to memorize words put the words in songs that you like be creative make learning fun let go of the destination and enjoy the journey. 

Lastly, 20 minutes before you go to bed, turn all electronics off and just be very quiet and say and repeat a few of the words that you want to remember over and over at least 5 times.  

Then just go to sleep. I have heard some people say you will be able to remember the words in the morning.

Now about me🙂👍🙏

So basically, there's never a time when I am specifically available. 


So, what you can do is send me text messages and audio voice messages and when you do I will correct your grammar and pronunciation any time that I log on to Hellotalk and am available. 


Also, understand I have a lot of people that I teach and when I say a lot, I mean a lot and make sure to keep in mind, that I'm doing this all for free voluntary. I'm not asking anyone to pay me. 


So, you can send messages talking about anything and I will correct them when I am available.  


I do not talk to people on phone calls. Only text messages and audio voice messages.🙂👍🙏

I mostly do my livestreams once a week. Sometimes,  if I feel okay I might do more than one a week and sometimes when I don't feel good. I'll do one every other week. 


The very first
piece of advice to follow when learning a language or doing anything is to display patience. Patience is very important, When learning anything.🙂👍🙏
